"""Routed-chat data types (RC-2, D-108).

The chat-route taxonomy is distinct from the message-level

which command handler serves an inbound message; :class:`ChatRoute`
decides which answer pipeline serves a ``/chat`` question once the
routed handler owns it. Core identifiers use the canonical
community/subject register (D-026 / D-041); the product-register labels
(``diary_lookup`` et al.) live in docs only — `docs/GLOSSARY.md` carries
the mapping.
